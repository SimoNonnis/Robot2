          <h2>About Robot2</h2>
          <p>I'm <em>Simon Nonnis</em>, a frontend developer. Robot2 is my tiny website where 
             I talk breafly about me and my most relevant work.
          </p>
          <p>I've been building websites from 2009, freelancing until 2013 when I felt the need to work in a totally different environment and joined 
             the <a href="http://www.ignitehospitality.com/about/" title="ignitehospitality.com">Ignite Team</a>. 
             I've worked there for 2 years, learning to build mobile first, responsive websites with wordpress. 
             I was never a fan of frameworks and premium themes so I've built from scratch 
             my own WP theme, <a href="https://github.com/SimoNonnis/ZeroWpTheme/blob/master/README.md" title="View on Github">ZeroWPTheme</a>, that was quickly adopted as 
             a foundation for every new project.
          </p>

          <h2>About WorkFlow</h2>
          <p>Every project is different, although there is a solid and general workflow that I follow.</p>

            <p>We will use the informations outlined in the planning stage to build a solid structure, that works in all major browser
               and different devices (mobile phones, tablet...). Focus will be on functionality and interactions between pages.
            </p>
            <h3><span class="n-workflow">3. </span>Painting</h3>
            <p>In this important and particular step we will work together on typography, colors, background images and textures.
               Mainly this step it is all about how to make your website shine.
            </p>
            <h3><span class="n-workflow">4. </span>Launch</h3>
