          <h2>About Robot2</h2>
          <p>I'm Simon Nonnis, a frontend developer. Robot2 is my tiny website where 
             I talk breafly about me and my most relevant work.
          </p>
          <p>I've been building websites from 2009, freelancing until 2013 when I felt the need to work in a totally different environment and joined 
             the <a href="http://www.ignitehospitality.com/about/" target="_blank">Ignite Team</a>. 
             I've worked there for 2 years, learning to build mobile first, responsive websites with wordpress. 
             I was never a fan of frameworks and premium themes so I've built from scratch 
             my own WP theme, <a href="https://github.com/SimoNonnis/ZeroWpTheme" target="_blank" >ZeroWPTheme</a>, that was quickly adopted as 
             a foundation for every new project.
          </p>
          
          <p>I gained an extensive experience on simplifying the process to collaborate 
             with UX designers and project managers to deliver stable, fast and high quality websites.
          </p>

          <p>In mid 2015 I felt the need to take a break and dedicate myself to learn Javascript in deep.
             My goal is to be able to join a team where Javascript is at the forefront on a daily basis.
             I am not at an expert level but when it comes to coding if you really enjoy it you’ll always keep progressing.
          </p>
          <p>"You don’t know JS" book series by 
             <a href="https://twitter.com/getify" target="_blank">Kyle Simpson</a> 
             are a fundamental resource into my learning process. 
             All the books are free to read on <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" target="_blank">Github</a>!  
             I’ve bought the books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_18?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=you+don%27t+know+javascript&amp;sprefix=you+don%27t+know+javascript%2Caps%2C204" target="_blank">hardcopies</a>, 
             because frequently I need to go back to some chapter and concept, so I have them for offline reading.
          </p>
          <p>During this time, I had a look at js frameworks like Angular, Ember or Meteor, 
             and I’ve come to realise that frameworks come and go so often in JavaScript that picking one might not be the right direction to take.
             But if you know JavaScript you are in a really good place with 
             <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/"  target="_blank">React</a>, 
             <a href="http://reactivex.io/"  target="_blank">RX</a> or 
             <a href="http://cycle.js.org/"  target="_blank">Cycle.js</a>.
          </p>
          <p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch6.md" target="_blank">OLOO (objects linking to other objects)</a> so I agree with Eric Elliot
             when he advocate against the use of <a href="https://vimeo.com/69255635" target="_blank">class pattern</a> in js.
