          <h2>About Robot2</h2>
          <p>I'm <em>Simon Nonnis</em>, a frontend developer. Robot2 is my tiny website where 
             I talk breafly about me and my most relevant work.
          </p>
          <p>I've been building websites from 2009, freelancing until 2013 when I felt the need to work in a totally different environment and joined 
             the <a href="http://www.ignitehospitality.com/about/" target="_blank">Ignite Team</a>. 
             I've worked there for 2 years, learning to build mobile first, responsive websites with wordpress. 
             I was never a fan of frameworks and premium themes so I've built from scratch 
             my own WP theme, <a href="https://github.com/SimoNonnis/ZeroWpTheme" target="_blank" >ZeroWPTheme</a>, that was quickly adopted as 
             a foundation for every new project.
          </p>
          
          <p>I gained an extensive experience on simplifying the process to collaborate 
             with UX designers and project managers to deliver stable, fast and high quality websites.
          </p>
             
          <p>Below you can see a short list of languages, tools, softwares that I love to work with.</p>

          <p>In mid 2015 I felt the need to take a break and dedicate myself to learn Javascript in deep.
             My goal is to be able to join a team where Javascript is at the forefront on a daily basis.
             I am not at an expert level but when it comes to coding if you really enjoy it you’ll always keep progressing.
          </p>
          <p>"You don’t know JS" book series by 
             <a href="https://twitter.com/getify" target="_blank">Kyle Simpson</a> 
             are a fundamental resource into my learning process. 
             All the books are free to read on <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" target="_blank">Github</a>!  
             I’ve bought the books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_18?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=you+don%27t+know+javascript&amp;sprefix=you+don%27t+know+javascript%2Caps%2C204" target="_blank">hardcopies</a>
             so I have them for offline reading and more importantly I was able to support Kyle with his good work.
