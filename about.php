          <h2>About Robot2</h2>
          <p>I'm <em>Simon Nonnis</em>, a frontend developer. Robot2 is my tiny website where 
             I talk breafly about me and my most relevant work.
          </p>
          <p>I've been building websites from 2009, freelancing until 2013 when I felt the need to work in a totally different environment and joined 
             the <a href="http://www.ignitehospitality.com/about/" target="_blank">Ignite Team</a>. 
             I've worked there for 2 years, learning to build mobile first, responsive websites with wordpress. 
             I was never a fan of frameworks and premium themes so I've built from scratch 
             my own WP theme, <a href="https://github.com/SimoNonnis/ZeroWpTheme" target="_blank" >ZeroWPTheme</a>, that was quickly adopted as 
             a foundation for every new project.
          </p>
          
          <p>I gained an extensive experience on simplifying the process to collaborate 
             with UX designers and project managers to deliever stable, fast and high quality websites.
          </p>
             
          <p>Below you can see a short list of languages, tools, software that I love to work with.</p>

          <p>In mid 2015 I felt the need to take a break and dedicate myself to learn Javascript in deep.
             My goal is to be able to join a team where Javascript is at the forefront on a daily basis.
             I’m by no means at an expert level and I’m still learning lots. 
             When it comes to coding no one is the best and if you really enjoy it you’ll always keep progressing.
          </p>
          <p>"You don’t know JS" book series by 
             <a href="https://twitter.com/getify" target="_blank">Kyle Simpson</a> 
             are a big part into learning relevant information about JavaScript. 
             All the books are on <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" target="_blank">Github</a> and free to view! 
             I’ve bought the books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_18?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=you+don%27t+know+javascript&amp;sprefix=you+don%27t+know+javascript%2Caps%2C204" target="_blank">hardcopies</a>
             so I have them for offline reading and more importantly I was able to support Kyle with his good work.
