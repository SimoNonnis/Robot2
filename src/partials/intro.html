    <h2>Keep it extremely simple</h2>
    <p>
      Complexity is the enemy of productivity. Shorter code with fewer moving
      parts is simpler to read and test, so as a developer my job is to
      simplify. Write code that works exactly as expected, is performant, is
      easy to understand and doesn't take too long to implement.
