    <h2>Keep it <i>extremely</i> simple</h2>
    <p>
      Complexity is the enemy of productivity. Simple code with fewer moving
      parts, it's easier to read and test. As a developer my job is to write
      code that works exactly as expected, it's performant and doesn't take too
      long to implement.
