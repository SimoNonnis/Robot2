making programming simpler

### Keep it extremely simple

Develop for users, clients, teammates, your future self.
You should strive not just writing code that works correctly, but code that make sense when examined,
easy to read and refactor.
Keep it extremely simple, 'cause code is mostly for humans, computers only cares about machine code.

Web development is not all that much about coding, but often
is about of figuring things out, getting in a mood to solving a small problem after the other;
sometime is coded related sometime is just doing research about tooling, sometime you get stucked and your
brain doesn't process information, sometimes is fiddling around with configuration files,
so to get better you need to cultivate your creative process to solve problems one piece at the time

The longer I'm programming and creating software, the more I notice that I build a lot of stuff that requires maintenance even though it should not. In particular a topic that just keeps annoying me is how quickly technology moves forward and how much effort it is to maintain older code that still exists but now stands on ancient foundations.

Functional programming opens up a different style of programming.

This in turn allows us to conceptualize problems and solutions in different ways.
There are two key features to functional programming:


###Purity
If you read about functional programming, you will eventually come across the
concept of pure and impure functions. Pure functions are functions that fulfill
two criteria:
Calling the function with the same inputs always returns the same output.
Calling the function produces no side-effects: No network calls; no files
read or written; no database queries; no DOM elements modified; no global
variables modified; and no console output. Nothing.

Now, the trouble with this is that the whole point of writing computer
programs is the side effects. Making a network call and rendering DOM
elements is at the core of what a web application does; it’s what JavaScript
was invented for.

So what’s an aspiring functional programmer to do? Well, the key is that
we don’t avoid impure functions entirely, we just give them a healthy
amount of respect, and put-off dealing with them until we absolutely have to.

Logic is thought. Effects are action. Therefore the wise think before acting,
and act only when the thinking is done.
If you try to perform effects and logic at the same time, you may create
hidden side effects which cause bugs in the logic. Keep functions small.
Do one thing at a time, and do it well.

In other words, with functional programming, we generally try and work out
the logic of what we’re trying to achieve first, before we do anything that
has potential side effects.

I pursuit the idea of simpler programming, FP helps me to go in the right direcion
