        In this section I like to share a list of my recent projects that I am proud of.
        Each of these websites represents an important step of my programming philosophy.
        My part in every project consisted of interacting with graphic designers and project managers designing
        information architecture, UX, functionalities and in parallel setting up infrastructures, building from scratch these responsive websites.
